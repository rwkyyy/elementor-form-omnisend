# elementor-form-omnisend
A basic plugin that allows you to integrate Elementor Forms with Omnisend on a form level, after submit, there are basic settings in the plugin file for it to work only with the email field, but it can be easily extended
# Steps to activate
1. install the plugin
2. activate it
3. go to any form in elementor editor
4. add action "after submit" > omnisend
5. configure api key (needs to be configured for every form)

Built using native Elementor Docs and Omnisend Docs, these two are the only dependencies as well

Contributions are welcomed

p.s. I did not build a time-out, maybe in time.
